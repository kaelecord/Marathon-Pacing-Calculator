# Finding the Optimal Marathon Pacing Strategy
## Overview
This project explores the science of marathon pacing and provides actionable insights to help runners optimize their race performance. Using race results from three major marathons—2022 and 2023 Indianapolis Monumental Marathon, 2022 Berlin Marathon, and 2024 Chicago Marathon—two models were developed to predict personalized pacing strategies based on a runner’s demographic and performance characteristics:
 - Weighted Average Model
 - Genetic Algorithm
These models leverage age, gender, and target finish time to recommend pacing strategies tailored to individual runners. The findings are presented through an interactive Streamlit web application, enabling marathoners and coaches to generate and explore customized pacing plans.

## Features
The web application provides the following capabilities:

 - Input Personal Details
   - Users input their age group, gender, and target finish time.
 - Generate Pacing Strategies
   - Two models are available for generating strategies: Weighted Average Model and Genetic Algorithm.
   - Strategies are tailored to the user and categorized as negative split, even split, or positive split.
 - Interactive Outputs
   - Pacing Chart: A visual representation of split times over the marathon.
   - Detailed Table: Displays individual split times and cumulative times for each segment of the race.
These outputs allow users to compare strategies and track their progress using on-course timing clocks during the race.

## Access the Application
The web application is hosted on Streamlit and integrates seamlessly with a GitHub repository to manage all files and updates. [Add the application URL here, e.g., https://yourapp.streamlit.app]
